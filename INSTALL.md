# Installation Guide

This document provides detailed instructions on how to install the Simple Scheme Interpreter into your own ChatGPT session.

## Prerequisites

- An active OpenAI account with access to ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT with Python coding capabilities enabled.

## Installation Steps

1. **Start a ChatGPT Session**: Open ChatGPT and initiate a session where you can write and execute Python code.

2. **Copy the Interpreter Code**: Copy the Scheme interpreter Python code from the `scheme_interpreter.py` file in this repository.

3. **Paste the Code into ChatGPT**: Paste the copied code into the ChatGPT Python code execution environment. Ensure that the entire code block is selected and executed.

4. **Test the Interpreter**: Run a simple Scheme expression, such as `(display "Hello, World!")`, to verify that the interpreter is working.

5. **Begin Using the Interpreter**: You can now begin running Scheme code within ChatGPT.

Note: Since the interpreter runs within the ChatGPT session, there is no traditional "installation" process. Each new session with ChatGPT will require you to paste the code again to use the interpreter.
